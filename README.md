# The Watering Hole

Welcome to The Watering Hole! This is a social media application for posting pictures of cool animals. 

A demo of the app can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cukv0qmRoNZ2XMyCB1G1QqzbzaIx5Nht/view?usp=sharing). This video demonstrates the simple frontend UI, and the interface with the backend of uploading images with tags, latitude, and longitude, and then scrolling through the "feed" view of every other post made, as well as filtering by tag.

Uses Flutter for the Android and iOS frontend, and Flask and MySQL for the backend. Made in a team of 3 students including myself for SENG 321: Requirements Engineering at UVic.
